# Video Embed Widget
This repository is associated with this [devnet article](https://community.kentico.com/articles/creating-a-video-embed-widget-with-visibility-conditions), which details the process of adding a video embed widget to the **Dancing Goat** sample site in Xperience by Kentico.

The current branch uses React components for the widget's properties. You can switch to the [other branch](https://github.com/kentico-matthews/Custom.XperienceByKentico.VideoEmbedWidget/tree/CSharpComponents) to see the same example with C# components.
